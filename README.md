# SOC-Log-Analyzer-Threat-Alert-System
# 🛡️ SOC Log Analyzer & Threat Alert System

A real-time Security Operations Center (SOC) simulator that analyzes logs, detects threats, and sends visual alerts based on severity. Built for aspiring Cybersecurity Engineers and SOC Analysts.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates how modern SOC teams analyze system logs to detect threats such as brute-force attacks, DDoS attempts, and unauthorized access. It provides a live threat feed and an interactive dashboard to visualize alerts and log activity.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🔍 **Log Analyzer**: Parses and processes simulated log data.
- ⚠️ **Threat Detection Engine**: Classifies alerts into severity levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
- 📊 **Live Threat Dashboard**: Real-time UI for security alerts, built with React + Tailwind.
- 📁 **Mock Data Feed**: Simulated logs representing common attack patterns.
- 🔐 **SOC Workflow Simulation**: Replicates how SOC teams handle alerts, triage, and response.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Frontend   | Backend / Logic | Tooling        |
|------------|------------------|----------------|
| React      | TypeScript       | Vite           |
| TailwindCSS| Mock JSON Engine | ESLint + Prettier |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Simulated logs** are continuously fed to the system.
2. Logs are parsed and analyzed for known attack signatures.
3. Each log entry is tagged with a **severity level** using detection logic.
4. The **UI displays real-time alerts** for SOC analysts to triage and respond.
